<a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/07/13/sodium-lauryl-sulfate.aspx#_edn6"><b>Sodium Laureth Sulfate</b></a>
<li> A surfactant, getergent, and emulsifier used in nearly all shampoos. Originated from coconuts, but the manufacturing process contaminates it with 1,4 dioxane, a carcinogenic by-product.</li>
<li> 16,000 studies have found sodium laureth sulfate to be linked to irritation of the skin and eyes, organ toxicity, developmental/reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption, ecotoxicology, and biochemical or cellular changes, and possible mutations and cancer.</li>
<li> The gradual, cumulative effects of long-term, repeated exposure to sodium laureth sulfate puts consumers in higher risk of negative health impacts.</li>
